This is a personal project to develop a functioning poker session tracker.
As the name suggests, one would use this app to record stats upon completing a full session playing poker.
Relevant stats inlcude win/loss, location, duration of time spent playing, and most importantly, relevant notes 
from the sessions
Serious poker players use such software to keep track of winrates, pay attention to patterns that occur, prepare 
for taxes, and to flex on friends (lol).
Motivation for the project came from trying to avoid using IOS apps that have the same functions but cost a monthly fee,

This app contains both front end/back end is still a work in progress.

To do:
authentication with username/password
standings with profit, hours played, hourly 
styling stuff
